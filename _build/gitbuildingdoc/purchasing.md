# Purchasing parts

The microscope contains quite a few parts which are not printed. The majority of these parts are bolts and motors which can be purchased in sets on Amazon or eBay. Currently there are lots of bolts needed for the microscope - in future iterations the number of bolts may be reduced. 

The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is currently (as of 2022) difficult to acquire. If you cannot find one, you can get away with using the Raspberry Pi Zero, although the framerate will be slightly slower to stream to the smartphone.
