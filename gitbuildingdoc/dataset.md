# Dataset of Helminth egg images

The dataset contains over 12,000 annotated images of helminth eggs in Kato-Katz faecal stains. The annotations were confirmed by expert parasitologists at the Ministry of Health Uganda, Vector Control Division, Kampala. 

Six common helminth species are represented in the dataset: 

* Schistosoma mansoni 
* Trichuris trichiura
* Hookworm
* Ascaris lumbricoides
* Hymenolepis nana
* Taenia solium 

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Helminth dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oliverjackhiggins/helminth-image-dataset)

Further information about the preparation of the dataset, and the subsequent analysis of the trained model can be found in the PhD thesis.
